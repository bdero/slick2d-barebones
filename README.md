Downloading and setting up with Eclipse
-----------------------------------
1. Launch Eclipse and configure a new workspace
2. Navigate to the new workspace directory in a terminal
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CheeseKeg/slick2d-barebones`
4. Go back to Eclipse and make a new Java project called `slick2d-barebones`; the project should then be populated with directories and files such as `README.md` and `lib/`
5. Try running the project; if it works, start jamming!
